# Installation
Christoph Lechner, 2025-12-11

## Initial remarks
For the preparation of the installation guide two virtual machines with fresh installations of Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS were used.

* (1) [Data Collection](doc/INSTALL1.md)
* (2) [Data Transfer](doc/INSTALL2.md)
* (3) [Analysis](doc/INSTALL3.md)

These steps can be readily adjusted to your environment.
Not in all cases, all steps need to be performed.
