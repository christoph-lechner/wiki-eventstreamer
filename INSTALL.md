# Installation
Christoph Lechner, 2025-12-11

## Initial remarks
For the preparation of the installation guide two virtual machines with fresh installations of Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS were used.
The step described in below documents can be readily adjusted to your specific environment.

The installation procedure was structured in three parts based on the [structure of the system](#structure-of-the-system)
* (1) [Data Collection](doc/INSTALL1.md)
* (2) [Data Transfer](doc/INSTALL2.md)
* (3) [Analysis](doc/INSTALL3.md)

Not in all cases all steps need to be performed.
