# README / List of Resources
This directory contains the following resources:
* [The DAGs for Apache Airflow version 3.1.3](airflow_dags/). They were developed with the Airflow developer version based on a single `docker-compose.yaml` file. Here, these are to be placed into the `dags/` directory. At least this configuration does not support the import from the modules when they are in a subdirectory of `dags/`.
* Version 1 of the import-and-merge scripts
