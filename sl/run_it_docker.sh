# The network debugging function of Firefox (or any other browser)

#   https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/why-does-streamlit-send-webhook-requests-to-fivetran-com/87353/2
# only analytics/telemetry data is sent, but let's switch it off anyhow.
# If you use config.toml file (has to be placed in home directory of user running it, which is a bit complicated with docker-ized program), the settings are
# [browser]
# gatherUsageStats = false

# But we can also do it on the command line

sudo docker run -it -p 8501:8501 -v ./app:/app streamlit --browser.gatherUsageStats=False
