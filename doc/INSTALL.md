The image above illustrates the structure of the system and the organization of the installation guide. This is the color key:
* blue: [Data Collection](INSTALL1.md)
* green: [Data Loading and Storage](INSTALL2.md), including data transfer
* red: [Analysis](INSTALL3.md)

Not in all cases all steps need to be performed. For instance, if you just want the tables to be populated, a combination of (1) and (2) might be sufficient.
